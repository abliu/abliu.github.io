I am a PhD student in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics at Harvard Medical School and a Fellow in the Emerging Leaders in Biosecurity program. In my PhD in Michael Springer's lab, I have published scientific research in infectious diseases, biosecurity and pandemic preparedness:

- the determination of optimal COVID-19 quarantine duration ([Liu, Springer et al. 2022 JAMA Network Open](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789427)),
- machine learning software for genetic engineering attribution ([Alley, Liu, Esvelt et al. 2020 Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19612-0)),
- DNA synthesis screening ([Gretton, Liu, Esvelt et al. 2020 SecureDNA](https://www.securedna.org/manuscripts)), and
- the evaluation of different proposed systems for early detection of new pandemics (ongoing).

I also consulted on the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense's [Apollo report](https://biodefensecommission.org/reports/the-apollo-program-for-biodefense-winning-the-race-against-biological-threats/), which recommends federal government policies to stop future pandemics.

Before working in bioinformatics and pandemic preparedness in my PhD, I worked for a few years in software, quantitative trading and data science. I completed my BA (Math) and MS (Computer Science) at Harvard.
