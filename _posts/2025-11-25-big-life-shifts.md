I thought it'd be fun to reflect on some events and learnings in my life that shifted my life trajectory. I'll start with this (outdated) tip for getting into Harvard.

### Science Research for Getting into "Elite" Colleges

In 2011, around **75%** of the forty Intel Science Talent Search (STS) finalist high school seniors got into at least one of Harvard, Yale, MIT, Stanford and Princeton. What a crazy percentage! For some reason, it seems that "elite" universities really valued young scientific researchers. This is the one hack I would've recommended back then for a high schooler trying to maximize their chances of an "elite" school admission.

I don't know if this hack still works. Colleges may not care so much about this anymore, and the hack may now be widely known and competitive to the point of diminishing returns. (Interestingly, it seems the number of applicants is now around [2,500](https://www.societyforscience.org/regeneron-sts/frequently-asked-questions/), which isn't too much larger than it was before.) Of course, there's also quite a bit of luck involved in placing in the top 40, but placing in the top 300 is still a good outcome.

But my parents' support for me to pursue one summer of science research back then luckily turned into a great college admissions outcome, in addition to a relatively happy and rewarding PhD later in my career.

Two notes:

1. The competition is now called the Regeneron Science Talent Search.
2. If you're wondering whether being an STS finalist was correlated rather than causal: on the day after the finalists were announced, I got a "likely letter" call from a Harvard admissions officer. So it seems likely related.

### Otherwise

Otherwise, I've been largely happy with many of the choices I've made, but I'm not sure if I can truly say they were the **best** choices. How can I know what would've happened on the other path? And everyone has different career priorities, so who's to say what's best?

- I tried a lot of 3-month internships/career paths before and during college and PhD: science academia, quant trading, software/tech, VC, electoral politics, and the biosecurity world.
- I spent five years getting a PhD in computational biology, and ended up spending that time on [scientific](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44199-7) [research](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789427) to guide pandemic policy in the midst of COVID-19.

I may expand on my reflections on these and other choices in the future.
